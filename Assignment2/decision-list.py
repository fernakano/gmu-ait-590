#
# This is an application that will work to do Word Sense Desambiguation for a specific word,
# on this case specifically the word "line".
# The application will receive training data from the file line-train.xml which contains multiple instances of sentences
# each of these sentences in the context are attributed to a specific sense "phone" or "product"
#
# We will use the Input data to create a decision List based on Yarowsky Decision list presented in class.
# The decision list will work based on the collocation of words [-2, -1, 1] of the Ambiguous word Line.
# after calculating the likelihood of the collocated words we will use that to try to predict the correct sense of the
# line-test.xml data which does not have the sense attributed to it.
# If no sense is found on Decision List, we will use the sense with higherst probability from the training data
# based on counts.
#
#
# After we are able to find the sense classifications for the line-test.xml we will run our scorer.py application to
# evaludate the results.
#
# The scorer.py application will take the answers from the main application and the line-answers.txt file and compare
# how good were our predictions and output the accuracy of our model.
# then it will output a confusion matrix to illustrate the performance.
#
# The expected output of current application is as follows:
#
# First use the inputs to create the decision list
# decision list likelihood is created based on the ConditionalFreqDistribution
# which is used in the ConditionalProbDist to get the likelihood of each collocated item in the collocation table.
# Decision LIst:
# {'position': '-1W telephone line', 'likelihood': 6.149747119504682, 'classification': 'phone'}
# {'position': '-1W car line', 'likelihood': 4.392317422778761, 'classification': 'product'}
# {'position': '1W line rose', 'likelihood': 2.3219280948873626, 'classification': 'product'}
# {'position': '-2W recently introduced line', 'likelihood': 2.8073549220576046, 'classification': 'product'}
#
#
# After we have the decison list we lookup the sense probability based on the max likelihood of collocations.
# and output in the same format as the line-answers.txt for easier scoring later on.
# Predicted answers:
# <answer instance="line-n.w8_059:8174:" senseid="phone"/>
# <answer instance="line-n.w7_098:12684:" senseid="phone"/>
# <answer instance="line-n.w8_119:16927:" senseid="product"/>
# <answer instance="line-n.w8_008:13756:" senseid="product"/>
#
# We read both line-answers.txt and my-line-answers.txt as input on the scorer to compare our results and find
# the accuracy of our predictions.
#
# Output from Scorer.py:
#
# Our Decision List Accuracy: 76.98 %
